# Group Research for week 13 On Node Security

I have jsut created this repo and assigned tasks randomly! We can swap if we want to do a particular topic. I am thinking of managing the repo but if anyone else wants to do it, I am happy to hand over. Let's start working together and arrange a group meeting on Slack. Also, feel free to add your vies here so that we can make progress and solve any issues we might have in the future regarding our research.

 ## Tasks one (Raj: owner or someone if you want!) 
I am going to collect informtion about *HTTPS*.
Security: (https, same origin, cookies, xss etc..)

 ## Task two (Hasanein)
Can you add your notes on *SAME ORIGIN*?


## Task three (Seraphine)

Can you add your notes on *COOKIES*?

## Task four (Francisca)

Can you add your notes on *XSS*?

You can do the following steps (you already know them):
 1. fork the repo,
 2. clone to your machine ($git clone <repo_url>),
 3. create a new branch locally ($git checkout -b <NAME/TOPIC>), for example, raj/https.
 4.  create a new file (my file: https.md or anything you like) and add your notes with links supporting your statements. You can think of adding definition, examples adn diagrams for more clearity.
 5. commit your changes to your branch ($git add . && git commit -m "Your message")
 6. make a pull request:
    1. push your changes to your forked repo of the main
        $git push -u origin <yourbranch>
    2. GO TO GITHUB AND CHECK THE BRANCH YOU PUSHED EARLIER AND 
        MAKE A PULL REQUEST.
7. we can review everyone's notes by arranging a meeting on slack to have finalised notes by making sure everyone understood everything in the notes.
