# Group Research for week 13 On Node

I have jsut created this repo and assigned tasks randomly! We can swap if we want to do a particular topic. I am thinking of managing the repo but if anyone else wants to do it, I am happy to hand over. Let's start working together and arrange a group meeting on Slack. Also, feel free to add your vies here so that we can make progress and solve any issues we might have in the future regarding our research.

 ## Tasks one (Raj: owner or someone if you want!) 

Security: (https, same origin, cookies, xss etc..)

 ## Task two (Hasanein)

Performance: Request lifecycle (from browser to server and back), Performance considerations and optimisations 

## Task three (Seraphine)

HTTP and REST: (headers, status codes, Cookies, REST)

## Task four (Francisca)

Node internals: Node event loop, Node core modules, async/sync (non-blocking operations)
